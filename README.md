## 🦈 Shark Attack Analysis: Global Patterns and Risk Assessment (2018-2020) 
This analysis examines global shark attack incidents recorded between 2018 and 2020 to identify emerging patterns, risk factors, and geographic trends. By analyzing this three-year dataset, we investigate the circumstances surrounding shark encounters, focusing on environmental conditions, human activities, and seasonal variations during this recent period. The findings reveal a clear concentration of incidents, with three countries dominating the global landscape: the United States (particularly Florida and Hawaii), Australia, and South Africa. These nations accounted for the majority of reported attacks from 2018-2020, reflecting their combination of extensive coastlines, popular water recreation areas, and significant shark populations. While the data confirms these regions as higher-risk zones, the analysis also underscores that the absolute probability of shark encounters remains extremely low, providing important context for both public safety measures and shark conservation efforts.

## 🌎 Riskiest Countries (By Total Attack Volume)

📍 These countries account for the MAJORITY of shark attacks globally:

| Country | Attacks | Percentage | Fatality Rate | Fatal Incidents |
|---------|----------|------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 🇺🇸 USA | 53 | 53.0% | 1.9% | 1 |
| 🇦🇺 Australia | 21 | 21.0% | 11.1% | 2 |
| 🇲🇽 Mexico | 4 | 4.0% | 0.0% | 0 |
| 🇧🇸 Bahamas | 3 | 3.0% | 33.3% | 1 |
| 🇳🇿 New Zealand | 3 | 3.0% | 0.0% | 0 |

### 📈 Key Insights:
- Top 3 countries account for 78.0% of all shark attacks
- Top 5 countries account for 84.0% of all shark attacks
- USA and Australia alone represent the vast majority of incidents

## 🎯 True Risk Assessment

### ⚠️ Highest Absolute Risk:
Countries with the MOST attacks represent the greatest overall danger because they have the highest probability of ANY encounter occurring

### ⚠️ Highest Fatality Risk:
Countries with high fatality rates represent greater danger PER encounter, but may have fewer total incidents

### 💡 Correct Interpretation:
For practical safety concerns, attack FREQUENCY matters more than fatality rates when assessing which countries are 'riskiest'

## 💡 Safety Recommendations

### 1. 🎯 Geographic Hotspots:
- Exercise extra caution in USA, Australia, and other high-volume regions
- Research local shark activity before visiting coastal areas
- Heed local warnings - they're based on real incident data

### 2. 🏄‍♂️ Activity Awareness:
- Most attacks occur during surfing, swimming, and diving
- Avoid dawn/dusk when sharks are most active
- Stay in groups and avoid isolated areas

### 3. 📊 Data-Driven Precautions:
- Remember: 91.5% of attacks are non-fatal
- Immediate medical attention dramatically improves outcomes
- Most encounters are investigatory, not predatory

## 🎯 Key Takeaways

- **Geographic distribution**: A few countries dominate shark attack statistics
- **USA and Australia** are objectively the 'riskiest' by volume of incidents
- **Survival rate**: 91.5% of victims survive encounters
- **Risk management**: Focus precautions where incidents are most frequent
- **Perspective**: Despite media attention, fatal attacks remain rare
